# StreamList React Application

## Overview

StreamList is a React-based web application designed to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface for managing navigation and user inputs. The app utilizes React Router for seamless page transitions and includes a basic form component on the homepage. This project lays the foundation for future pages to be developed in subsequent weeks.


## Features

### Navigation Bar

Links to four pages:

- StreamList (Homepage): Displays a functional form for user input.
- Movies Page: Placeholder for future development in Week 4.
- Cart Page: Placeholder for future development in Week 4.
- About Page: Placeholder for future development in Week 5.
Styled with CSS for a modern and intuitive user experience.

### StreamList Page (Homepage)

Functional form where users can:
    Input the name of a stream.
    Submit the form to log the input to the console.
    Reset the input field automatically after submission.
    Responsive Design

Application is styled with CSS for responsiveness and usability across devices.


## Technologies Used 
- Frontend Framework: React (created using create-react-app)
- Routing: React Router (react-router-dom)
- Styling: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## How It Works

1. Navigation Bar

Implemented using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Link components from react-router-dom.
Allows seamless navigation between pages without reloading the page.

2. StreamList Form

Uses Reactâ€™s useState to manage input.
Logs input to the console upon submission and clears the field for the next entry.

3. CSS Styling

Ensures a clean, modern look with hover effects and responsive design.
